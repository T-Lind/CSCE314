## Haskell Instructions
To run a file, first ensure you have `ghci` installed.

Then, use `cabal` to install any packages you might need. For example, you'll likely need `HUnit`, which you can install via `cabal install --lib HUnit`.

Then, you can build your file with `ghc <filename>.hs` and lastly run it using `<filename>.exe` (or `./filename` on Unix-based systems).
